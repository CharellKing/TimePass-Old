the descriptions:	
	It's a library about shared memory called "TimePass".It imitate the stl and redis and has these containers (array, list ,doubly_list, queue, set, multiset, hashset, hashmulitset, map, multimap, hashmap, hashmultimap).

	/example: this directory has all the test examples of all containers.
	/src:	  this directory has all the containers
	/automake.sh: make and install shell, it's very convenient.
	/clean.sh	remove the cmake and install files.

the library's requires:
	1. CMAKE 2.6 above: 
	you can make the project as below(you must have gone into the project's root directory):
		cd src
		mkdir build
		cd build
		cmake ..
		make && make install
	the libs and includes are installed into the /usr/local/TIME_PASS

	you can make the examples as below:
		cd example
		mkdir build
		cd build
		cmake ..
		make && make install
	the excutable files are installde into exaple/bin

	2.if you want to make project easily, you can execute as below:
		sh automake.sh
	the shell code is strictly passed in bash.

	3.the shared memory is based on posix shared memory apis. so it's used in most of linux and unix operating system, but not windows.
	
	4. if you want to run the example with '-r' argument, you should intall the graphviz. because the comman is used to convert the data structure into pictures with the dot language.

the copyleft:
	The code is protected by BSD LINENCE. You can't use it in commercial activicties directly.
